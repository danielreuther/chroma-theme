Chroma Theme
============

Chroma is a Liferay Theme Plugin that is meant to provide a pragmatic look and feel that can be adjusted via several configurable options. Its two different views allow for using it in public website–scenarios as well as for administration or dashboard-style interfaces while providing a common look and feel when switching between them.

Features:
- Default and Dashboard view
- Option to automatically switch to Dashboard view for logged in users.
- Theme colors can be adjusted via a set of Color Pickers in the configuration menu.
- Fontawesome-based site logo that can be configured in the Theme's settings.
- Option to hide the dockbar by default.
